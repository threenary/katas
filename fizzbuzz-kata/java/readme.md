# FizzBuzz Kata

This is the simplest Kata you can start with.
Is itended for you to practice Baby Steps, this is, do the whole TDD cicle.

## Task
Write a function that takes numbers and outputs them as a string,
 but for multiples of 3, it returns __Fizz__ instead of the number, 
 and for multiples of 5, it returns __Buzz__ . 
 
 For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, it returns __FizzBuzz__.
