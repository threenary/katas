# Game Of Life Kata

## Task
Implement a finite version of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Rules
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states: `alive` or `dead`. 

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to it. 

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 

The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one)

Your game should be constructed with initial state of a two-dimensional array of boolean values, and a single public method to move to the next generation:
````
public class GameOfLife {
  public GameOfLife(boolean[][] board);
  public void nextGen();
}
````
### Constraints
- The dimensions of the array stay constant throughout the game - the 'universe' never grows.
- Cells outside the bounds of the array should be considered permanently dead (they never come to life).
