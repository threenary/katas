# Katas

This is the bucket where I keep a series of [Coding Katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) I have worked with, recurrently, during years although many times left behind a public repo.

> A Code Kata is like a gym routine, you practices your moves until you find the best way to achieve the same result

## Content
Within each folder there is a contained solution approach to different common katas. They were developed in aim to become familiar and used to the TDD practices, 
starting, as with everything, with Baby Steps.

All of them have been covered initially in Java, and some contain solutions different languages.
The goal is to keep adding and growing them to later be able to compare approaches and find similarities, advantages and dissadvantages based on the potentiallity that each language provides.
